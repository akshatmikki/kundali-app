Since Saturn approximately takes around two and half years to transit a sign which is called Shanis dhaiya it takes around seven and half year to transit three signs and that is why it is known as Sadhe Sati. Generally Sade-Sati comes thrice in a horoscope in the life time - first in childhood, second in youth & third in old-age. First Sade-Sati has effect on education & parents. Second Sade-Sati has effect on profession, finance & family.

Natives born with Sun in Taurus face a lot of difficulties and challenges in life. When it comes to their physique and health, such people suffer from lack of immunity and bodily weakness. They are also vulnerable to diseases related to face or eyes. Water may also pose some risks and dangers to these natives. This position of Sun also gives dissatisfaction from spouse so not favorable for marriage. Nevertheless, such natives tend to be good-looking and humble natured. They are astute and wise, with good knowledge of performing arts such as singing, dance and music. In fact, at times they can also play musical instruments. They are usually well off, endowed with a rich lifestyle. They tend to earn a lot of wealth and financial gains

Sun is a ball of fire, and when Saturn, an airy malefic planet sits in Sun’s fiery sign Leo, it naturally fans the flames. Due to this inimical relationship between Sun and Saturn, the native born under Saturn in Leo has a lot of aggression in their personality. Sun represents father and authority, and when Saturn is placed in Leo, it causes problems in relationship of the native with his or her father or authoritative figure. Such people like to live in solitude, much like a lion. They want to live like wanderers, free and undisturbed. Saturn in Leo gives a medium height and stature to the native. Such people are usually very stubborn, tough to move. They work hard in life and often work towards achieving a leadership role. They are skillful and able to carry the load of work and responsibilities. As parents, these natives tend to be quite disciplined. Such people have a lot of interest in creative fields such as writing and reading. They know that they have the talent inside but struggle to express themselves creatively.
