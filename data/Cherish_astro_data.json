Watery Venus here exerts its energy like pockets of water that trap the air inside and form bubbles. Consider these bubbles as Libra natives, who are strongly influenced by the surface tension of the water. Venus represents love, and Libra have a strong need for relationships in their life, they function at best when among others, just like bubbles stick together. These natives have the ability to understand others’ feelings and emotions. They are highly romantic people, with a charming personality. They are emotional and easily fall in love with the goodness in others. These natives want to be surrounded by pleasantness and beauty. There is a strong need for love, absence of which does not work out in their favor. The priority of their life is a 'happily ever after marriage'.

Sadhe Sati starts when Saturn (Shani) enters the 12th sign from the birth Moon sign and ends when Saturn leaves 2nd sign from the birth Moon sign. Since Saturn approximately takes around two and half years to transit a sign which is called Shanis dhaiya it takes around seven and half year to transit three signs and that is why it is known as Sadhe Sati. Generally Sade-Sati comes thrice in a horoscope in the life time - first in childhood, second in youth & third in old-age. First Sade-Sati has effect on education & parents. Second Sade-Sati has effect on profession, finance & family. The last one affects health more than anything else.",
