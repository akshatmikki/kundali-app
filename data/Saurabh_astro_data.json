Sadhe Sati starts when Saturn (Shani) enters the 12th sign from the birth Moon sign and ends when Saturn leaves 2nd sign from the birth Moon sign. Since Saturn approximately takes around two and half years to transit a sign which is called Shanis dhaiya it takes around seven and half year to transit three signs and that is why it is known as Sadhe Sati. Generally Sade-Sati comes thrice in a horoscope in the life time - first in childhood, second in youth & third in old-age. First Sade-Sati has effect on education & parents. Second Sade-Sati has effect on profession, finance & family. The last one affects health more than anything else.",

You want freedom in life, but you are quite demanding when it comes to relationships. You are always up for an adventure, and a routine life bores you like anything. Monotony makes you miserable.

Mercury in Scorpio gives a disposition and speech that sounds harsh, candid and at times aggressive too.  But Mercury also gives a logical mind so while Moon in Scorpio gives unbridled passion, Mercury in Scorpio gives sanity and rationality so the native’s decisions are more driven by logic than emotions. At times though, these natives tend to take impulsive actions that they have to repent later. There is a strong desire to unmask the hidden truths and mysteries of life in these natives. Whatever they say or write has a deeper meaning to it and is generally quite insightful. They tend to use sharp language to articulate what they have in mind.
