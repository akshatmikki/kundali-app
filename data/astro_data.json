Sadhe Sati starts when Saturn (Shani) enters the 12th sign from the birth Moon sign and ends when Saturn leaves 2nd sign from the birth Moon sign. Since Saturn approximately takes around two and half years to transit a sign which is called Shanis dhaiya it takes around seven and half year to transit three signs and that is why it is known as Sadhe Sati. Generally Sade-Sati comes thrice in a horoscope in the life time - first in childhood, second in youth & third in old-age. First Sade-Sati has effect on education & parents. Second Sade-Sati has effect on profession, finance & family. The last one affects health more than anything else.",

With Moon’s influence in this placement, the native is usually of a wavering mind. This indecisiveness hampers their undertakings. While the person is endowed with qualities of a king and earns a lot of fame, he or she struggles to enjoy the comfort associated with having a partner. Natives with Sun in Cancer are virtuous beings, follow a pious path in life and abide by the moral principles. Such people tend to be good-looking and have a magnetic personality. Activities related to space and atmosphere interest them a lot, so they tend to do well as scientist too. They can also become artists depending upon the placement of other planets in the chart. These natives however have to work harder than usual to fulfill their goals and that keeps them distressed at times. Overall, this is a positive placement.",

Others often misunderstand them. They are hard working but they can be mischievous in their ways. They also indulge in illicit activities and can be sinful and jealous. They are not that reliable either. They are often blamed for their own wrongdoings.",
